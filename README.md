With this application, companies are able to schedule deliveries, keep track of customer information, and view the equipment that is needed for each delivery. Users are also able to select the equipment that is needed for each delivery along with the quantity of the items that are needed. A calendar and map are also implemented in order to view the deliveries needed for each day and the fastest route to the location.
